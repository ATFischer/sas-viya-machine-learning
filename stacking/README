Ensemble modeling is now a well-established means for improving prediction accuracy; it enables you to average out noise from diverse models and thereby enhance the generalizable signal. Basic stacked ensemble techniques combine predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms and use these predictions as inputs to second-level learning models. This repo privides examples
